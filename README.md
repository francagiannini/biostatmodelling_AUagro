## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Choose and apply exploratory data tools to discover patterns in data.
* Recognise experimental designs and appropriately handle them statistically.
* Employ common statistical methods (e.g., General Linear Mixed Models, GLMM) for data analysis and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
* Describe, interpret and discuss the results and shortcomings of an analysis based on statistical modelling.
* Build attractive and informative graphics and tables from applied statistical analysis.
* Report the results of an applied statistical analysis according to ethics of science.

## 📖 Course Content

### Module 1: Handling Ag Data through R (Pre-workshop)
*Necessary to complete 5 ECTS (1.5 ECTS, 48 hours)*.

1.  **Getting started:** Introduction to R and RStudio, syntax, and work projects.
2.  **Data frames:** Reading/importing data (Excel, etc.), sorting, and creating subsets.
3.  **Graphics:** Base R `plot()` and advanced plotting with `ggplot2`.
4.  **Functions:** Defining custom functions, loops, and the `apply` family.
5.  **Descriptive statistics:** Variability, central tendency, skew, kurtosis, and data management.

### Module 2: Hands-on Data - Applied Statistics (Main Course)
*(3.5 ECTS, 90 hours)*.

1.  **Exploratory analysis:** Qualitative and quantitative data types.
2.  **Statistical modelling:** Notation, uncertainty, and covariate modeling.
3.  **Experimental design:** Randomization, replication, factorial structures, crossed/nested factors, and split-plot designs.
4.  **Mixed Models (GLMM):** Simple/multiple linear regression, random effects, BLUPs, and longitudinal data.
5.  **Communication:** Reproducible research (Git/GitHub), Open Data, and good presentation practices.

## 🎓 Assessment
Individual student evaluation (**Pass/Not Pass**) is based on the analysis of their own research data. This culminates in a **poster session** and an open-door session where students present their findings and demonstrate their ability to interpret results within their specific research context.

## 📅 Detailed Course Schedule

The course is structured into a 3-day R Pre-workshop followed by a week-long intensive Biostatistics module. All sessions run from **09:00 to 17:00**.
