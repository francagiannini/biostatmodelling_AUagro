## 🎓 Assessment
Individual student evaluation (**Pass/Not Pass**) is based on the analysis of their own research data. This culminates in a **poster session** and an open-door session where students present their findings and demonstrate their ability to interpret results within their specific research context.

## 📅 Detailed Course Schedule

The course is structured into a 3-day R Pre-workshop followed by a week-long intensive Biostatistics module. All sessions run from **09:00 to 17:00**.
